# Contacts
Hyperskill.org project to learning OOP basics (Java)


### About
This project provides an opportunity to create simple contacts like person(with fields name, surname, address, phone etc.)
and Organiation(with fields organization name, address, phone number). Type of contacts can be easily expanded by adding a new class.  
It is possible to add, remove, edit, search, show contacts.

I implement here two patterns: Factory for getting type of contact and Template Method for menu implementation. I guess pattern realization is far from ideal
but i'm trying to get better:) 

There is a mechanism for saving data. It saves the data to a file through serialization and restores it through deserialization and do not use databases.
